A line with slope $m$ that passes through the point $(x_1, y_1)$ has equation $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.

The other key idea is that for any $n$ , modulo $z^n$ , polynomials of the form $1 - zf(z)$ are invertible, with inverse \\[\\frac{1}{1 - zf(z)}\\equiv\\frac{1 - (zf(z))^n}{1 - zf(z)} = 1 + zf(z) + \\cdots + (zf(z))^{n - 1}).\\] Therefore, for the polynomial in the problem, call it $g(z)$ , we can still form the expression $zg'(z)\/g(z)$ , which is what we originally got by taking the logarithmic derivative and multiplying by $z$ , and expand it to eventually get \\[\\sum_{n = 1}^{32} nb_n\\sum_{k = 1}^{32} z^{nk}\\equiv\\sum_{n = 1}^{32} 2^nz^n\\pmod{z^{33}},\\] which gets us the same relations (for $n\\leq 32$ ).\nSolution 3\nFrom the starting point of Solution 2, \\[(1 - z)^{b_1}(1 - z^2)^{b_2}(1 - z^3)^{b_3}\\cdots = 1 - 2z,\\] taking reciprocals and expanding with geometric series gives us \\[\\prod_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} z^{kn}\\right)^{b_n} = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} 2^nz^n.\\] On the right, we have the generating function for the number of monic polynomials of degree $n$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ of two elements, and on the left, we have the factorisation of this generating function that considers the breakdown of any given monic polynomial into monic irreducible factors. As such, we have the interpretation \\[b_n = \\text{number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree }n\\text{ over }\\mathbb{F}_2.\\] From here, to determine $b_n$ , we analyse the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ , of which there are $2^{n}$ in total. Given $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ , if the minimal polynomial $f_{\\alpha}$ of $\\alpha$ has degree $d$ , then $d\\mid n$ and all other roots of $f_{\\alpha}$ appear in $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ . Moreover, if $d\\mid n$ and $f$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree $d$ , then all roots of $f$ appear in $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ . (These statements are all well-known in the theory of finite fields.) As such, for each $d\\mid n$ , there are precisely $db_d$ elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ of degree $d$ , and we obtain the same equation as in Solution 2, \\[\\sum_{d\\mid n} db_d = 2^n.\\] The rest is as before.\n ","answer":"\\[ k = 2^{27} - 2^{11} \\]","source":"usamo","secondary_domain":"Algebra"}

Since consecutive odd integers differ by 2, the other four odd integers are $x+2, x+4, x+6$, and $x+8$. Therefore, $x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 125$.

{"domain":["Mathematics -> Algebra -> Algebra -> Polynomial Operations","Mathematics -> Discrete Mathematics -> Logic","Mathematics -> Number Theory -> Prime Numbers"],"difficulty":7.5,"problem":"Determine all functions $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(f(a)-b)+b f(2 a)$ is a perfect square for all integers $a$ and $b$.","solution":"There are two families of functions which satisfy the condition: (1) $f(n)= \\begin{cases}0 & \\text { if } n \\text { is even, and } \\\\ \\text { any perfect square } & \\text { if } n \\text { is odd }\\end{cases}$ (2) $f(n)=n^{2}$, for every integer $n$. It is straightforward to verify that the two families of functions are indeed solutions. Now, suppose that f is any function which satisfies the condition that $f(f(a)-b)+b f(2 a)$ is a perfect square for every pair $(a, b)$ of integers. We denote this condition by $\\left(^{*}\\right)$. We will show that $f$ must belong to either Family (1) or Family (2). Claim 1. $f(0)=0$ and $f(n)$ is a perfect square for every integer $n$. Proof. Plugging $(a, b) \\rightarrow(0, f(0))$ in $\\left(^{*}\\right)$ shows that $f(0)(f(0)+1)=z^{2}$ for some integer $z$. Thus, $(2 f(0)+1-2 z)(2 f(0)+1+2 z)=1$. Therefore, $f(0)$ is either -1 or 0 . Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $f(0)=-1$. For any integer $a$, plugging $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, f(a))$ implies that $f(a) f(2 a)-1$ is a square. Thus, for each $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there exists $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(a) f(2 a)=x^{2}+1$ This implies that any prime divisor of $f(a)$ is either 2 or is congruent to $1(\\bmod 4)$, and that $4 \\nmid f(a)$, for every $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Plugging $(a, b) \\rightarrow(0,3)$ in $\\left(^{*}\\right)$ shows that $f(-4)-3$ is a square. Thus, there is $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(-4)=y^{2}+3$. Since $4 \\nmid f(-4)$, we note that $f(-4)$ is a positive integer congruent to $3(\\bmod 4)$, but any prime dividing $f(-4)$ is either 2 or is congruent to $1(\\bmod 4)$. This gives a contradiction. Therefore, $f(0)$ must be 0 . For every integer $n$, plugging $(a, b) \\rightarrow(0,-n)$ in $\\left(^{*}\\right)$ shows that $f(n)$ is a square. Replacing $b$ with $f(a)-b$, we find that for all integers $a$ and $b$, $$\\begin{equation*} f(b)+(f(a)-b) f(2 a) \\text { is a square. } \\tag{**} \\end{equation*}$$ Now, let $S$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $f(n)=0$. We have two cases: - Case 1: $S$ is unbounded from above. We claim that $f(2 n)=0$ for any integer $n$. Fix some integer $n$, and let $k \\in S$ with $k>f(n)$. Then, plugging $(a, b) \\mapsto(n, k)$ in $\\left({ }^{* *}\\right)$ gives us that $f(k)+(f(n)-k) f(2 n)=(f(n)-k) f(2 n)$ is a square. But $f(n)-k<0$ and $f(2 n)$ is a square by Claim 1. This is possible only if $f(2 n)=0$. In summary, $f(n)=0$ whenever $n$ is even and Claim 1 shows that $f(n)$ is a square whenever $n$ is odd. - Case 2: $S$ is bounded from above. Let $T$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $f(n)=n^{2}$. We show that $T$ is unbounded from above. In fact, we show that $\\frac{p+1}{2} \\in T$ for all primes $p$ big enough. Fix a prime number $p$ big enough, and let $n=\\frac{p+1}{2}$. Plugging $(a, b) \\mapsto(n, 2 n)$ in $\\left(^{* *}\\right)$ shows us that $f(2 n)(f(n)-2 n+1)$ is a square for any integer $n$. For $p$ big enough, we have $2 n \\notin S$, so $f(2 n)$ is a non-zero square. As a result, when $p$ is big enough, $f(n)$ and $f(n)-2 n+1=f(n)-p$ are both squares. Writing $f(n)=k^{2}$ and $f(n)-p=m^{2}$ for some $k, m \\geq 0$, we have $$(k+m)(k-m)=k^{2}-m^{2}=p \\Longrightarrow k+m=p, k-m=1 \\Longrightarrow k=n, m=n-1$$ Thus, $f(n)=k^{2}=n^{2}$, giving us $n=\\frac{p+1}{2} \\in T$. Next, for all $k \\in T$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, plugging $(a, b) \\mapsto(n, k)$ in $\\left({ }^{* *}\\right)$ shows us that $k^{2}+(f(n)-k) f(2 n)$ is a square. But that means $(2 k-f(2 n))^{2}-\\left(f(2 n)^{2}-4 f(n) f(2 n)\\right)=4\\left(k^{2}+(f(n)-k) f(2 n)\\right)$ is also a square. When $k$ is large enough, we have $\\left|f(2 n)^{2}-4 f(n) f(2 n)\\right|+1<|2 k-f(2 n)|$. As a result, we must have $f(2 n)^{2}=4 f(n) f(2 n)$ and thus $f(2 n) \\in\\{0,4 f(n)\\}$ for all integers $n$. Finally, we prove that $f(n)=n^{2}$ for all integers $n$. Fix $n$, and take $k \\in T$ big enough such that $2 k \\notin S$. Then, we have $f(k)=k^{2}$ and $f(2 k)=4 f(k)=4 k^{2}$. Plugging $(a, b) \\mapsto(k, n)$ to $\\left(^{* *}\\right)$ shows us that $f(n)+\\left(k^{2}-n\\right) 4 k^{2}=\\left(2 k^{2}-n\\right)^{2}+\\left(f(n)-n^{2}\\right)$ is a square. Since $T$ is unbounded from above, we can take $k \\in T$ such that $2 k \\notin S$ and also $\\left|2 k^{2}-n\\right|>\\left|f(n)-n^{2}\\right|$. This forces $f(n)=n^{2}$, giving us the second family of solution.","answer":"\n[\n     $$\n     f(n) = \n     \\begin{cases} \n     0 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\ \n     \text{any perfect square} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \n     \\end{cases}\n     $$;\n     $$\n     f(n) = n^{2} \\quad \text{for every integer } n.\n     $$\n]\n","source":"apmoapmo_sol","secondary_domain":"Algebra"}
{"domain":["Mathematics -> Algebra -> Abstract Algebra -> Field Theory"],"difficulty":6.0,"problem":"Let $p>2$ be a prime number. $\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ is defined as the set of all polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ (the integers modulo $p$ with usual addition and subtraction), so that two polynomials are equal if and only if the coefficients of $x^{k}$ are equal in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ for each nonnegative integer $k$. For example, $(x+2)(2 x+3)=2 x^{2}+2 x+1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{5}[x]$ because the corresponding coefficients are equal modulo 5 . Let $f, g \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$. The pair $(f, g)$ is called compositional if $$f(g(x)) \\equiv x^{p^{2}}-x$$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$. Find, with proof, the number of compositional pairs (in terms of $p$ ).","solution":"Answer: $4 p(p-1)$ Solution 1. First, notice that $(\\operatorname{deg} f)(\\operatorname{deg} g)=p^{2}$ and both polynomials are clearly nonconstant. Therefore there are three possibilities for the ordered pair $(\\operatorname{deg} f, \\operatorname{deg} g)$, which are $\\left(1, p^{2}\\right),\\left(p^{2}, 1\\right)$, and $(p, p)$. In the subsequent parts of the solution, equalities are modulo $p$. If $f(x)=a x+b, a \\neq 0$ is linear, then it is invertible so then $g$ is uniquely determined as $g(x)=f^{-1}(f(g(x)))=\\frac{x^{p^{2}}-x-b}{a}$. Similarly, if $g(x)=c x+d, c \\neq 0(\\bmod p)$ is linear then $f$ is uniquely determined as $f(x)=f\\left(g\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)\\right)=$ $\\left(\\frac{x-d}{c}\\right)^{p^{2}}-\\left(\\frac{x-d}{c}\\right)$. In each case there are $p(p-1)$ compositional pairs. The last case is $\\operatorname{deg} f=\\operatorname{deg} g=p$. We take the derivative of both sides (we use the formal derivative $D_{x} f(x)=\\sum_{n \\geq 1} n f_{n} x^{n-1}$, which satisfies the usual chain and product rules but can be used on arbitrary polynomials, including those in $\\left.\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]\\right)$. Thus $$f^{\\prime}(g(x)) g^{\\prime}(x)=p^{2} x^{p^{2}-1}-1=-1$$ using that $p=0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. Now $g^{\\prime}(x)$ and $f^{\\prime}(g(x))$ must both be constant polynomials. Since $g$ is nonconstant, this means that $f^{\\prime}(x)$ is also a constant polynomial. We must be careful here, as unlike in $\\mathbb{R}$, nonlinear polynomials can have constant derivatives. From the formula of derivative, we see that $h^{\\prime}(x)=0$ as a polynomial exactly when $h(x)$ is a linear combination of $1, x^{p}, x^{2 p}, \\ldots$ (remember that $p=0$ ). Thus $f^{\\prime}, g^{\\prime}$ both being constant and $f, g$ being of degree $p$ tells us $$f(x)=a x^{p}+b x+c, g(x)=d x^{p}+e x+f$$ where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are some elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. Now we must have $$a\\left(d x^{p}+e x+f\\right)^{p}+b\\left(d x^{p}+e x+f\\right)+c=x^{p^{2}}-x$$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$. We use the fact that $(x+y)^{p}=x^{p}+y^{p}$ as polynomials in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$, since the binomial coefficients $\\binom{p}{j} \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq p-1$. This implies $(x+y+z)^{p}=x^{p}+y^{p}+z^{p}$. Therefore we can expand the previous equation as $$a\\left(d^{p} x^{p^{2}}+e^{p} x^{p}+f^{p}\\right)+b\\left(d x^{p}+e x+f\\right)+c=x^{p^{2}}-x$$ Equating coefficients, we see that $$\\begin{aligned} a d^{p} & =1, \\\\ a e^{p}+b d & =0, \\\\ b e & =-1, \\\\ a f^{p}+b f+c & =0 \\end{aligned}$$ The first and third equations imply that $a, d, b, e$ are nonzero $(\\bmod p)$ and $a=d^{-p}, b=-e^{-1}$. Then $a e^{p}+b d=0$ gives $$d^{-p} e^{p}-e^{-1} d=0$$ or $e^{p+1}=d^{p+1}$. Recalling that $e^{p-1}=d^{p-1}=1$ in $(\\bmod p)$, this tells us $d^{2}=e^{2}$ so $d= \\pm e$. Furthermore, any choice of such $(d, e)$ give unique $(a, b)$ which satisfy the first three equations. Finally, once we have determined $a, b, d, e$, any choice of $f$ gives a unique valid choice of $c$. Thus we have $p-1$ choices for $d$, two choices for $e$ after choosing $d$ (n.b. for $p=2$ there is only one choice for $e$, so the assumption $p>2$ is used here), and then $p$ choices for $f$, for a total of $2 p(p-1)$ compositional pairs in this case. Finally, adding the number of compositional pairs from all three cases, we obtain $4 p(p-1)$ compositional pairs in total. Solution 2. The key step is obtaining $$f(x)=a x^{p}+b x+c, g(x)=d x^{p}+e x+f$$ in the case where $\\operatorname{deg} f=\\operatorname{deg} g=p$. We present an alternative method of obtaining this, with the rest of the solution being the same as the first solution. Let $$\\begin{aligned} & f(x)=f_{p} x^{p}+f_{p-1} x^{p-1}+\\cdots+f_{0} \\\\ & g(x)=g_{p} x^{p}+g_{p-1} x^{p-1}+\\cdots+g_{0} \\end{aligned}$$ where $f_{p}, g_{p}$ are nonzero. Like before, we have $g(x)^{p}=g\\left(x^{p}\\right)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$, so $$x^{p^{2}}-x=f_{p} g\\left(x^{p}\\right)+f_{p-1} g(x)^{p-1}+\\cdots+f_{0}$$ Consider the maximal $k<p$ for which $f_{k} \\neq 0$. (It is not hard to see that in fact $k \\geq 1$, as $f_{p} g\\left(x^{p}\\right)+f_{0}$ cannot be $x^{p^{2}}-x$.) First assume that $k>1$. We look at the $x^{k p-1}$ coefficient, which is affected only by the $f_{k} g(x)^{k}$ term. By expanding, the coefficient is $k f_{k} g_{p}^{k-1} g_{p-1}$. Therefore $g_{p-1}=0$. Then we look at the $x^{k p-2}$ coefficient, then the $x^{k p-3}$ coefficient, etc. down to the $x^{k p-p+1}$ coefficient to conclude that $g_{p-1}=g_{p-2}=\\cdots=g_{1}=0$. However, then the $x$ coefficient of $f(g(x))$ is zero, contradiction. Therefore we must have $k=1$, so $f$ is of the form $a x^{p}+b x+c$. Using the same method as we used when $k>1$, we get $g_{p-1}=g_{p-2}=\\cdots g_{2}=0$, though the $x^{k p-p+1}$ coefficient is now the $x$ coefficient which we want to be nonzero. Hence we do not obtain $g_{1}=0$ anymore and we find that $g$ is of the form $d x^{p}+e x+f$.","answer":"4 p(p-1)","source":"HMMT_2","secondary_domain":"Algebra"}

Thus, $\\frac{1}{2} A D \\cdot B C=84$, and so $A D=12$. By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangles $A B D$ and $A C D, B D=5$ and $C D=9$. The inradius of $A B D, r_{A B D}$, is $\\frac{[A B D]}{s_{A B D}}$, where $[A B D]$ is the area of $A B D$ and $s_{A B D}$ is its semiperimeter. $A B D$ is a $5-12-13$ right triangle, so $[A B D]=30$ and $s_{A B D}=15$. Thus, $r_{A B D}=2$. Similarly, we get that $A C D$'s inradius is $r_{A C D}=3. I_{1} Y_{1} D X_{1}$ is a square, so $X_{1} D=I_{1} X_{1}=r_{A B D}=2$, and similarly $X_{2} D=3. X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are on opposite sides of $D$, so $X_{1} X_{2}=X_{1} D+X_{2} D=5$. Since $P$ lies on lines $I_{1} I_{2}, X_{1} X_{2}$, and $I_{1} X_{1}, I_{2} X_{2}$ are parallel, triangles $P X_{1} I_{1}$ and $P X_{2} I_{2}$ are similar. Thus, $\\frac{X_{1} I_{1}}{X_{2} I_{2}}=\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{P X_{1}}{P X_{2}}=\\frac{P X_{1}}{P X_{1}+X_{1} X_{2}}=\\frac{P X_{1}}{P X_{1}+5}$. Solving gives $P X_{1}=10$. Letting $\\angle I_{1} P X_{1}=\\theta$, since $I_{1} X_{1} P$ is a right angle, we have $\\tan \\theta=\\frac{X_{1} I_{1}}{X_{1} P_{1}}=\\frac{1}{5}$. $D$ and $E$ lie on different common external tangents, so $P I_{1}$ bisects $\\angle E P D$, and thus $\\angle E P D=2 \\theta$. Thus, $\\tan \\angle E P D=\\tan 2 \\theta=\\frac{2 \\tan \\theta}{1-\\tan ^{2} \\theta}=\\frac{5}{12}$. $E D$ is perpendicular to $B C$, so triangle $E D P$ is a right triangle with right angle at $D$. Thus, $\\frac{5}{12}=$ $\\tan \\angle E P D=\\frac{E D}{P D}. P D=P X_{1}+X_{1} D=12$, so $E D=5. A D=12$, so it follows that $A E=7$.

Let $\\ell_{A}, \\ell_{B}$ be their common external tangents, and $\\ell_{C}$ be one of their common internal tangents. $\\Omega_{1}$ intersects $\\ell_{A}, \\ell_{B}$ at points $A_{1}, B_{1}$, respectively, and $\\Omega_{2}$ intersects $\\ell_{A}, \\ell_{B}$ at points $A_{2}, B_{2}$. If $\\ell_{C}$ intersects $\\ell_{A}$ at $X$, and $\\ell_{B}$ at $Y$, then $X Y=A_{1} A_{2}=B_{1} B_{2}$. Proof: Let $\\ell_{C}$ intersect $\\Omega_{1}, \\Omega_{2}$ at $C_{1}, C_{2}$, respectively. Then, examining the tangents to $\\Omega_{1}, \\Omega_{2}$ from $X, Y$, we have $A_{1} X=C_{1} X, A_{2} X=C_{2} X, B_{1} Y=C_{1} Y, B_{2} Y=C_{2} Y$. Thus, $2 A_{1} A_{2}=2 B_{1} B_{2}=$ $A_{1} A_{2}+B_{1} B_{2}=A_{1} X+A_{2} X+B_{1} Y+B_{2} Y=C_{1} X+C_{2} X+C_{1} Y+C_{2} Y=2 X Y$, and the conclusion follows. Using the notation from above, we apply the lemma to circles $\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}$, and conclude that $E D=X_{1} X_{2}$. Then, we proceed as above to compute $X_{1} X_{2}=5=E D$.

Given that there exists a circle that intersects the hexagon at 12 distinct points, we have $M<a<N$ for some real numbers $M$ and $N$. Determine the minimum possible value of the ratio $\\frac{N}{M}$.","solution":"We claim that the greatest possible value of $M$ is $\\sqrt{3}-1$, whereas the least possible value of $N$ is 3 . To begin, note that the condition requires the circle to intersect each side of the hexagon at two points on its interior. This implies that the center must be inside the hexagon as its projection onto all six sides must be on their interior. Suppose that the hexagon is $A B C D E F$, with $A B=B C=D E=E F=1$, $C D=F A=a$, and the center $O$. When $a \\leq \\sqrt{3}-1$, we note that the distance from $O$ to $C D$ (which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ ) is greater than or equal to the distance from $O$ to $B$ or $E$ (which is $\\frac{a+1}{2}$ ). However, for the circle to intersect all six sides at two points each, the distance from the center of the circle to $C D$ and to $F A$ must be strictly less than that from the center to $B$ and to $E$, because otherwise any circle that intersects $C D$ and $F A$ at two points each must include $B$ or $E$ on its boundary or interior, which will not satisfy the condition. WLOG assume that the center of the circle is closer to $F A$ than to $C D$, including equality (in other words, the center is on the same side of $B E$ as $F A$, possibly on $B E$ itself), then note that the parabola with foci $B$ and $E$ and common directrix $C D$ intersects on point $O$, which means that there does not exist a point in the hexagon on the same side of $B E$ as $F A$ that lies on the same side of both parabola as $C D$. This means that the center of the circle cannot be chosen. When $a=\\sqrt{3}-1+\\epsilon$ for some very small real number $\\epsilon>0$, the circle with center $O$ and radius $r=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ intersects sides $A B, B C, D E, E F$ at two points each and is tangent to $C D$ and $F A$ on their interior. Therefore, there exists a real number $\\epsilon^{\\prime}>0$ such that the circle with center $O$ and radius $r^{\\prime}=r+\\epsilon^{\\prime}$ satisfy the requirement. When $a \\geq 3$, we note that the projection of $B F$ onto $B C$ has length $\\left|\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{a}{2}\\right| \\geq 1$, which means that the projection of $F$ onto side $B C$ is not on its interior, and the same goes for side $E F$ onto $B C$. However, for a circle to intersect both $B C$ and $E F$ at two points, the projection of center of the circle onto the two sides must be on their interior, which cannot happen in this case. When $a=3-\\epsilon$ for some very small real number $\\epsilon>0$, a circle with center $O$ and radius $r=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(a+1)$ intersects $A F$ and $C D$ at two points each and is tangent to all four other sides on their interior. Therefore, there exists a real number $\\epsilon^{\\prime}>0$ such that the circle with center $O$ and radius $r^{\\prime}=r+\\epsilon^{\\prime}$ satisfy the requirement. With $M \\leq \\sqrt{3}-1$ and $N \\geq 3$, we have $\\frac{N}{M} \\geq \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}-1}=\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}+3}{2}$, which is our answer.","answer":"\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}+3}{2}","source":"HMMT_11","secondary_domain":"Geometry"}

(Multiple Choice) 0.64, 1, 1.44, 1.96, 4","solution":"Comments In the 60's - 70's, the following question appeared in All-Union Math Olympiad of USSR: A tetradehron $V_{1}$ sits inside another tetrahedron $V_{2}$, prove that the sum of edge lengths of $V_{1}$ does not exceed $\\frac{4}{3}$ times that of $V_{2}$. What is anti-intuitive is that, on a plane, if a triangle sits inside another triangle, then not only the area of the first triangle is strictly smaller than that of the second one, but the perimeter also is. Now in a three dimensional situation, though the \"order\" of volume and surface is still kept, it is not the case for the sum of edge lengths. The \"origine\" of the problem is likely the following paper in Polish: Holszty\u0144ski, W. and Kuperberg, W., O pewnej wlasn\u00f3sci czworo\u015bcian\u00f3w, Wiadomo\u015bci Matematyczne 6 (1962), 14-16. They published an English version some 15 years later: Holszty\u0144ski, W. and Kuperberg, W., On a Property of Tetrahedra, Alabama J. Math. 1(1977), 4042 . Then in 1986, Carl Linderholm of the University of Alabama generalized the above result to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces: Theorem. Let $S$ and $T$ be two $m$-dimensional simplexes in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the first being inside the second, and $1 \\leqslant r \\leqslant m$. The there exists constants $B_{m, r}$, such that the sum of all $r$ dimensional faces of $S$ does not exceed $B_{m, r}$ times that of $T$. Here $B_{m, r}$ is calculated as follows: Let $m+1=(r+1) q+s$ (Euclidean division), then $$ B_{m, r}=\\frac{q^{r+1-s}(q+1)^{s}}{m+1-r} $$ (CARL LINDERHOLM, AN INEQUALITY FOR SIMPLICES, Geometriae Dedicata (1986) $21,67-73$. Now back to the current problem, the Choice (A) is trivial, so we focus on: why $(\\mathrm{B}),(\\mathrm{C})$ and $(\\mathrm{D})$ can be realized? why (E) cannot? The mathematics that we need here is: (A) a little geometric topology: an octahedron with all faces being triangles has $3 \\times 8 \/ 2=12$ edges, so by Euler's Formula, the number of vertices is 6 . (B) a bit of graph theory: if one vertex has degree 5 , then by a very easy argument one has another vertex with degree 5 also, and the degrees of the vertices are (5,5,4,4,3,3). The only other possibility is that every vertex has degree 4 (like that of a regular ocrahedron). (C) a little bit of convex geometry: as we consider convex octahedron, so the maximum distance of two points on it must be attained between two vertices. If every vertex of the big octahedron is of degree 4 , and the maximum distance lis realized between two vertices $A$ and $B$ that are NOT adjacent, then as the other four vertices are all adjacent to them, so $\\ell_{2}$ is at least $4 \\ell_{2}$ (and can be arbitrarily close to that valur when the other four vertices are close enough to line $A B$ ), and for the small octahedron, if every vertex is of degree 4 , we can make three vertices very close to $A$, while the other three very close to $B$, so $\\ell_{1}$ would be very close to $6 \\ell_{2}$. Hence any ratio less than 1.5 is realizable. ( so the Choices (A),(B) and (C)) If the maximum distance $\\ell$ is realized between two vertices of degree 3 in the big octahedron, then $\\ell_{2}$ is at least $3 \\ell_{2}$ (and can be arbitrarily close to that valur when the other four vertices are close enough to line $A B$ ), while for the small octahedron, we can still take each vertex to be of degree 4 , and three of them very close to $A$, while the other three very close to $B$, so $\\ell_{1}$ would be very close to $6 \\ell_{2}$. Hence any ratio less than 2 is realizable. ( so the Choice (D)) Actually, if the small octahedron has the some topological configuration as that of the big one, and the two vertices of degree 5 are very close to each other, while the other four vertices are very close together, then the ratio can actually approach $8 \/ 3$. After some easy case by case discussion, we conclude that, if the maximum distance $\\ell$ is realized between a vertex of degree $a$ and a vertex of degree $b$ (whether they are adjacent or not), one has always $\\ell_{2}$ is at last $\\min (a, b) \\ell$, while obviously $\\ell_{1}$ cannot exceed $12 \\ell_{2}$, So (E)is impossible.","answer":"(A), (B), (C), (D)","source":"alibaba_global_contest","secondary_domain":"Geometry"}

Therefore, an icosahedron has 5 triangles meeting at each vertex, so rotating by $\\frac{360^{\\circ}}{5}=72^{\\circ}$ gives another identical icosahedron.

Checking all three possibilities, $$\\begin{aligned} & 12 t-2(t)+720 t \\equiv 697 t \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 1), \\\\ & t-2(12 t)+720 t \\equiv 730 t \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 1), \\\\ & t-2(720 t)+12 t \\equiv-1427 t \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 1) . \\end{aligned}$$ Then we require $t$ to be a multiple of $\\frac{1}{697}, \\frac{1}{730}$, or $\\frac{1}{1427}$. Since 697,730, and 1427 are pairwise relatively prime, the possible values of $t$ are $$\\begin{array}{r} \\frac{1}{697}, \\frac{2}{697}, \\ldots, \\frac{696}{697}, \\frac{698}{697}, \\ldots, \\frac{2 \\cdot 697-1}{697} \\\\ \\frac{1}{730}, \\frac{2}{730}, \\ldots, \\frac{729}{730}, \\frac{731}{730}, \\ldots, \\frac{2 \\cdot 730-1}{730} \\\\ \\frac{1}{1427}, \\frac{2}{1427}, \\ldots, \\frac{1426}{1427}, \\frac{1428}{1427}, \\ldots, \\frac{2 \\cdot 1427-1}{1427} \\end{array}$$ since $t \\in[0,2]$. This gives a count of $2((697-1)+(730-1)+(1427-1))=5702$. Note that in the above count we don't count $t=0,1,2$ since then all three hands would overlap. If two hands overlap, then one of $11 t, 708 t, 719 t \\equiv 0(\\bmod 1)$, and the only way one of these can happen and $t$ being a multiple of $\\frac{1}{697}, \\frac{1}{730}$, or $\\frac{1}{1427}$ is if $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=\\frac{3}{2}$ (which correspond to 6:00 AM and \\mathrm{PM}). This is because the only pair of numbers that are not relatively prime among 11, 708, 719, 697, 730,1427 is 708 and 730. The only common divisor of these two numbers is 2, hence $t=\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}$. Thus the final answer is $5702-2=5700$.","answer":"5700","source":"HMMT_11","secondary_domain":"Geometry"}

Therefore, we merely have to calculate $\\frac{1}{2}$ times the number of values of $k$ for which $r_{a} \\neq r_{b}$ and $r_{a} \\neq 0$ .\n However, the answer is NOT $\\frac{1}{2}(2012) = 1006$ ! This is because we must count the cases where the value of $k$ makes $r_{a} = r_{b}$ or where $r_{a} = 0$ .\n So, let's start counting.\n If $k$ is even, we have either $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1006}$ or $a - b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1006}$ . So, $a = 1006$ or $a = b + 1006$ . We have $1005$ even values of $k$ (which is all the possible even values of $k$ , since the two above requirements don't put any bounds on $k$ at all).\n If $k$ is odd, if $k = 503$ or $k = 503 \\cdot 3$ , then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ or $a \\equiv b \\pmod{4}$ . Otherwise, $ak \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2012}$ or $ak \\equiv bk \\pmod{2012}$ , which is impossible to satisfy, given the domain $a, b < 2012$ . So, we have $2$ values of $k$ .\n In total, we have $2 + 1005 = 1007$ values of $k$ which makes $r_{a} = r_{b}$ or $r_{a} = 0$ , so there are $2011 - 1007 = 1004$ values of $k$ for which $r_{a} \\neq r_{b}$ and $r_{a} \\neq 0$ . Thus, by our reasoning above, our solution is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1004 = \\boxed{502}$ .\n Solution by $\\textbf{\\underline{Invoker}}$ \nSolution 3\nThe key insight in this problem is noticing that when $ak$ is higher than $bk$ , $a(2012-k)$ is lower than $b(2012-k)$ , except at $2 \\pmod{4}$ residues*. Also, they must be equal many times. $2012=2^2*503$ . We should have multiples of $503$ . After trying all three pairs and getting $503$ as our answer, we win. But look at the $2\\pmod{4}$ idea. What if we just took $2$ and plugged it in with $1006$ ?\nWe get $502$ .\n-- Va2010 11:12, 28 April 2012 (EDT)va2010\nSolution 4\nSay that the problem is a race track with $2012$ spots. To intersect the most, we should get next to each other a lot so the negation is high.

We note that if $2^{x}=2^{y}$ for some real numbers $x$ and $y$, then $x=y$. We examine equations of the form $2^{a}+2^{b}=2^{c}+2^{d}$ where $a, b, c$, and $d$ are integers. We may assume without loss of generality that $a \\leq b$ and $c \\leq d$ and $a \\leq c$. We factor the equation as $2^{a}(1+2^{b-a})=2^{c}(1+2^{d-c})$, and then divide both sides by $2^{a}$ to obtain $1+2^{b-a}=2^{c-a}(1+2^{d-c})$. We show that $c=a$ by contradiction: If $c \\neq a$, then $c \\geq a$ gives $c>a$. If $c>a$, then $c-a>0$, so $c-a \\geq 1$, since $c-a$ is an integer. Therefore, the right side has a factor of $2^{c-a}$, so the right side is even. Thus, the left side is even too, which means that $2^{b-a}$ must be an odd integer. For $2^{b-a}$ to be an odd integer, we must have $2^{b-a}=1$ and so $b-a=0$ or $b=a$. In this case, the left side equals 2 and the right side is greater than 2, since $2^{c-a} \\geq 2$ and $1+2^{d-c}>1$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $c=a$. Since $a=c$, then $2^{a}+2^{b}=2^{c}+2^{d}$ becomes $2^{b}=2^{d}$ and so $b=d$. Therefore, if $2^{a}+2^{b}=2^{c}+2^{d}$ with $a, b, c, d$ integers, then either $a=b=c=d$ or $a=c$ and $b=d$ (with $a \\neq b$) or $a=d$ and $b=c$ (with $a \\neq b)$. We examine these three possibilities in the given equation, noting that $m, n$ and $k$ are all positive integers: Case 1: $4m^{2}=m^{2}-n^{2}+4=k+4=3m^{2}+n^{2}+k$. From the last equality, we obtain $3m^{2}+n^{2}=4$. Since $m, n$ are positive integers, then $m^{2} \\geq 1$ and $n^{2} \\geq 1$. Since $3m^{2}+n^{2}=4$, then it must be that $m=n=1$. Thus, $4m^{2}=k+4$ implies $4=k+4$ or $k=0$. But $k>0$, so this case is not possible. Case 2: $4m^{2}=k+4$ and $m^{2}-n^{2}+4=3m^{2}+n^{2}+k$ and $4m^{2} \\neq m^{2}-n^{2}+4$. From the second equality, we obtain $2m^{2}+2n^{2}+k=4$, which is not possible since $m, n, k>0$, and so $2m^{2}+2n^{2}+k \\geq 5$. Therefore, this case is not possible. Case 3: $4m^{2}=3m^{2}+n^{2}+k$ and $m^{2}-n^{2}+4=k+4$ and $4m^{2} \\neq m^{2}-n^{2}+4$. The first equality rearranges to $m^{2}-n^{2}=k$. The second equality also rearranges to $m^{2}-n^{2}=k$. The last statement is equivalent to $3m^{2}+n^{2} \\neq 4$. As we saw in Case 1, this means that $(m, n)$ cannot be the pair $(1,1)$, which is consistent with $m^{2}-n^{2}=k$ and $k>0$. Therefore, having examined all of the cases, we have reduced the original problem to finding the number of odd integers $k$ between 0 and 100 for which the equation $m^{2}-n^{2}=k$ has exactly two pairs of positive integers $(m, n)$ that are solutions. Step 2: Connecting solutions to $m^{2}-n^{2}=k$ with factorizations of $k$. We can factor the left side of this equation to give $(m+n)(m-n)=k$. Since $m, n$ and $k$ are positive integers, then $m+n>0$ and $k>0$ so $m-n>0$, or $m>n$. Since $k$ is odd and each of $m+n$ and $m-n$ is an integer, then each of $m+n$ and $m-n$ is odd (since if either was even, then their product would be even). Also, we note that $m+n>m-n$ since $n>0$. Suppose that $(m, n)$ is a solution of the equation $m^{2}-n^{2}=k$ with $m+n=a$ and $m-n=b$ for some odd positive integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$. Then $ab=k$, so $ab$ is a factorization of $k$. Therefore, the solution $(m, n)$ corresponds to a specific factorization of $k$. Now suppose that we start with a factorization $k=AB$ where $A$ and $B$ are odd positive integers with $A \\geq B$. If we try setting $m+n=A$ and $m-n=B$, then we can add these equations to give $2m=A+B$ (or $m=\\frac{1}{2}(A+B)$) and subtract them to give $2n=A-B$ (or $n=\\frac{1}{2}(A-B)$). Note that since $n>0$, then $A>B$. Therefore, every factorization of $k$ as the product of two odd positive integers $A$ and $B$ with $A>B$ gives a solution to the equation $m^{2}-n^{2}=k$. Since each solution gives a factorization and each factorization gives a solution, then the number of solutions equals the number of factorizations. Therefore, we have reduced the original problem to finding the number of odd integers $k$ between 0 and 100 which have exactly two factorizations as the product of distinct odd integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$. Step 3: Counting the values of $k$. Since $k$ is odd, then all of its prime factors are odd. Since $k<100$, then $k$ cannot have three or more distinct odd prime factors, because the smallest possible product of three distinct odd prime factors is $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7=105$. Thus, $k$ has two or fewer distinct prime factors. If $k=pq$ for distinct primes $p<q$, then the divisors of $k$ are $1, p, q, pq$, so $k$ has exactly two factorizations of the desired type (namely $1 \\cdot pq$ and $p \\cdot q$). Since $k<100$ and $p \\geq 3$, then $q<\\frac{100}{3}$. Since $q$ is an integer, then $q \\leq 33$. The odd primes less than 33 are $3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31$. If $p \\geq 11$, then $pq>11^{2}=121$, which is larger than 100. Therefore, $p$ can only be 3,5 or 7. If $p=3$, there are 9 possible values for $q$ (primes from 5 to 31). If $p=5$, there are 5 possible values for $q$ (primes from 7 to 19). If $p=7$, there are 2 possible values for $q$ (11 and 13). Thus, there are $9+5+2=16$ values of $k$ of this form that work. If $k=p^{r}q^{s}$ with $r$ and $s$ positive integers and at least one of $r$ or $s$ is larger than 1, then $k$ will have at least three factorizations. (For example, if $r>1$, then $k=1 \\cdot p^{r}q^{s}=p \\cdot p^{r-1}q^{s}=p^{r} \\cdot q^{s}$ and all of these are distinct.) If $k=p$ or $k=p^{2}$ with $p$ an odd prime, then $k$ has only one factorization as the product of distinct factors ($1 \\cdot p$ and $1 \\cdot p^{2}$, respectively). Thus, $k$ cannot be of this form. If $k=p^{3}$ with $p$ an odd prime, then the divisors of $k$ are $1, p, p^{2}, p^{3}$, so it has exactly two factorizations of the desired type (namely $1 \\cdot p^{3}$ and $p \\cdot p^{2}$). Since $k<100$, then $p$ can only equal 3 (because $5^{3}>100$). Thus, there is 1 value of $k$ of this form that works. If $k=p^{4}$ with $p$ an odd prime, then the divisors of $k$ are $1, p, p^{2}, p^{3}, p^{4}$, so it has exactly two factorizations of the desired type (namely $1 \\cdot p^{4}$ and $p \\cdot p^{3}$). In this case, $k$ has a third factorization, but it is of the wrong type since the two factors will be equal. Since $k<100$, then $p$ can only equal 3 (because $5^{4}>100$). Thus, there is 1 value of $k$ of this form that works. If $k$ has more than 4 factors of $p$, then $k$ will have at least three factorizations of the desired type, so $k$ cannot be of this form. (In particular, if $k=p^{n}$ and $n>4$, then $k=1 \\cdot p^{n}=p \\cdot p^{n-1}=p^{2} \\cdot p^{n-2}$ and these are all distinct since $n-2>2$.) Having examined all of the possible forms, we see that there are $16+1+1=18$ values of $k$ that work, and so there are 18 positive integer solutions to the original equation.","answer":"18","source":"fermat","secondary_domain":"Number Theory"}

From the given equation, $3m^{3}=5n^{5}$, $3(3^{a}5^{b}s)^{3}=5(3^{c}5^{d}t)^{5}$, $3 \\times 3^{3a}5^{3b}s^{3}=5 \\times 3^{5c}5^{5d}t^{5}$, $3^{3a+1}5^{3b}s^{3}=3^{5c}5^{5d+1}t^{5}$. Since $s$ and $t$ are not multiples of 3 or 5, we must have $3^{3a+1}=3^{5c}$ and $5^{3b}=5^{5d+1}$ and $s^{3}=t^{5}$. Since $s$ and $t$ are positive and $m$ and $n$ are to be as small as possible, we can set $s=t=1$, which satisfy $s^{3}=t^{5}$. Since $3^{3a+1}=3^{5c}$ and $5^{3b}=5^{5d+1}$, then $3a+1=5c$ and $3b=5d+1$. Since $m$ and $n$ are to be as small as possible, we want to find the smallest positive integers $a, b, c, d$ for which $3a+1=5c$ and $3b=5d+1$. Neither $a=1$ nor $a=2$ gives a value for $3a+1$ that is a multiple of 5, but $a=3$ gives $c=2$. Similarly, $b=1$ does not give a value of $3b$ that equals $5d+1$ for any positive integer $d$, but $b=2$ gives $d=1$. Therefore, the smallest possible values of $m$ and $n$ are $m=3^{3}5^{2}=675$ and $n=3^{2}5^{1}=45$, which gives $m+n=720$.","answer":"720","source":"cayley","secondary_domain":"Number Theory"}

This is because the units digit of $k$ and the units digit of $k^{2}$ must match (by the definition of an Anderson number) and because the units digit of $k$ completely determines the units digit of $k^{2}$. (We can see this by doing \"long multiplication\".) So we need to look for two-digit Anderson numbers $k$ with digits $c 6$. \n Another way of writing the number $c 6$ is $k=10 c+6$. (This form uses the place values associated with the digits.) \n In this case, $k^{2}=(10 c+6)^{2}=(10 c+6)(10 c+6)=(10 c)^{2}+6(10 c)+10 c(6)+6^{2}=100 c^{2}+120 c+36$. Note that $k^{2}=100\\left(c^{2}+c\\right)+10(2 c+3)+6$ and so the units digit of $k^{2}$ is 6. \n For $k$ to be an Anderson number, we need the tens digit of $k^{2}$ to be $c$, in which case the final two digits of $k^{2}$ will be $c 6$. \n Thus, the tens digit of $k^{2}$ is equal to the units digit of $2 c+3$. \n This means that $k=10 c+6$ is an Anderson number exactly when the units digit of $2 c+3$ is equal to the digit $c$. \n When we check the nine possible values for $c$, we find that the only possibility is that $c=7$. \n This means that $k=76$ is the only two-digit even Anderson number. \n Note that $76^{2}=5776$, which ends with the digits 76. \n Next, we look for three-digit even Anderson numbers $k$. \n Using a similar argument to above, we see that $k$ must have digits $b 76$. \n In other words, $k=100 b+76$ for some digit $b$. \n In this case, $k^{2}=(100 b+76)^{2}=10000 b^{2}+15200 b+5776$. \n We note that the tens and units digits of $k^{2}$ are 76, which means that, for $k$ to be an Anderson number, the hundreds digit of $k^{2}$ must be $b$. \n Now $k^{2}=1000\\left(10 b^{2}+15 b+5\\right)+100(2 b+7)+76$. \n Thus, $k$ is an Anderson number exactly when the units digit of $2 b+7$ is equal to the digit $b$. \n Again, checking the nine possible values for $b$ shows us that $b=3$ is the only possibility. \n This means that $k=376$ is the only three-digit even Anderson number. \n Note that $376^{2}=141376$, which ends with the digits 376. \n Since Anderson numbers are less than 10000, then we still need to look for four-digit even Anderson numbers. \n Again, using a similar argument, we see that $k$ must have digits $a 376$. \n In other words, $k=1000 a+376$ for some digit $a$. \n In this case, $k^{2}=(1000 a+376)^{2}=1000000 a^{2}+752000 a+141376$. \n We note that the hundreds, tens and units digits of $k^{2}$ are 376, which means that, for $k$ to be an Anderson number, the thousands digit of $k^{2}$ must be $a$. \n Now $k^{2}=10000\\left(100 a^{2}+75 a+14\\right)+1000(2 a+1)+376$. \n Thus, $k$ is an Anderson number exactly when the units digit of $2 a+1$ is equal to the digit $a$. Again, checking the nine possible values for $a$ shows us that $a=9$ is the only possibility. \n This means that $k=9376$ is the only four-digit even Anderson number. \n Note that $9376^{2}=87909376$, which ends with the digits 9376. \n Thus, $S$, the sum of the even Anderson numbers, equals $6+76+376+9376=9834$. \n The sum of the digits of $S$ is $9+8+3+4=24$.","answer":"24","source":"pascal","secondary_domain":"Number Theory"}

We construct an $n$-omino by starting with a single square and attaching squares, one by one, as close to order we just defined as possible. After the first square is placed, the next square can be attached to its bottom or right side. If the second square is right of the first, then the third square can be attached to the top, right, or bottom edges of the second. The third square cannot be attached to the first square, because the first column must be completed before the second is begun.

This can be done either by placing the new cube on the ground or on top of the previously placed cube. \n\nLet's analyze the process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Cube Placement**: When starting with the first cube, there are no choices; it must be placed on the line.\n\n2. **Choices for Subsequent Cubes**: For each subsequent cube, the child has two choices:\n   - Place it directly next to the previous cube on the same level (ground level).\n   - Place it on top of the previous cube.\n\n3. **Recursive Formulation**: \n   - After placing the first cube, each additional cube requires a decision to be made independently of the previous decisions, except where cubes are supported.\n   - Hence, for each cube from the second to the \\( n \\)-th, there are 2 independent choices to be made.\n\n4. **Counting Distinct Structures**: \n   - This leads to a binary decision problem for each cube position, starting from the second one. \n   - Therefore, there are \\( 2^{n-1} \\) distinct ways to arrange the \\( n \\) cubes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: For \\( n \\) cubes, the number of distinct walls is determined by the number of binary choices we make for the position of each cube starting from the second cube, which equates to \\( 2^{n-1} \\).\n\nThus, the number of distinct walls that can be constructed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^{n-1}}\n\\]\n","answer":"2^{n-1}","source":"pan_african MO","secondary_domain":"Combinatorics"}

What is the largest possible sum that can appear along one of the diagonals?","solution":"Our answer is $26+52+54+56+58+60+62+64$. One possible configuration: WLOG, we seek to maximize the sum of the numbers on the main diagonal (top left to bottom right). If we color the squares in a checker-board pattern and use the fact that $a$ and $a+1$ lie on different colored squares, we notice that all numbers appearing on the main diagonal must be of the same parity. Consider the smallest value $m$ on the main diagonal. All numbers from 1 to $m-1$ must lie on one side of the diagonal since the main diagonal disconnects the board into two regions, and by assumption, all numbers less than $m$ cannot lie on the main diagonal. Therefore, $m \\leq 29$ (one more than the seventh triangular number) But if $m=29$, then the sum of the numbers on the main diagonal is at most $29+51+53+55+57+59+61+63=428$, as these numbers must be odd. Similarly, $m=27$ is also not optimal. This leaves $m=28$ as a possibility. But if this were the case, the only way it beats our answer is if we have $28+52+54+\\ldots+64$, which would require $52,54, \\ldots, 64$ to appear sequentially along the diagonal, forcing 28 to be in one of the corners. Now label the squares (row, column) with $(1,1)$ being the top left and $(8,8)$ being the bottom right. Assume WLOG that 28 occupies $(1,1)$. Since 62 and 64 are in $(7,7)$ and $(8,8)$, respectively, we must have 63 in $(7,8)$ or $(8,7)$, and WLOG, assume it's in $(8,7)$. Since 61 is next to 60, it is not difficult to see that $(7,8)$ must be occupied by 1 (all numbers $a$ between 2 and 60 must have $a-1$ and $a+1$ as neighbors). Since 1 is above the main diagonal, all numbers from 1 to 27 must also be above the main diagonal. Since there are 28 squares above the main diagonal, there is exactly one number above the main diagonal greater than 28. Notice that 61 must occupy $(7,6)$ or $(6,7)$. If it occupies $(7,6)$, then we are stuck at $(8,6)$, since it must contain a number between 2 and 59, which is impossible. Therefore, 61 must occupy $(6,7)$, and no more numbers greater than 28 can be above the main diagonal. This forces $59,57,55$, and 53 to occupy $(6,5),(5,4),(4,3),(3,2)$, respectively. But we see that 27 occupies $(1,2)$ and 29 occupies $(2,1)$, leaving nowhere for 51. This is a contradiction, so our answer is therefore optimal. Alternate solution: Another method of proving that $m \\leq 26$ is to note that each side of the diagonal has 28 squares, 16 of which are one color and 12 of which are the other color. As the path has to alternate colors, one can make at most $13+12=25$ steps before moving on the diagonal.","answer":"432","source":"HMMT_2","secondary_domain":"Combinatorics"}

If we use forty-two of these pieces, they will cover a total of:\n\\[\n42 \\times 4 = 168 \\quad \\text{(squares)}.\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that only the central square should remain uncovered. Therefore, out of the 169 squares, we need 168 squares to be covered by the \\(4 \\times 1\\) pieces, which matches exactly the coverage provided by the forty-two pieces.\n\nNow we focus on ensuring that the uncovered square is precisely at the center of the chessboard. The central square can be identified at position \\((7, 7)\\) on the \\(13 \\times 13\\) grid.\n\nTo evaluate if it is possible to arrange the \\(4 \\times 1\\) pieces so that only the \\((7, 7)\\) position remains uncovered, consider the fact that each \\(4 \\times 1\\) piece spans four consecutive squares either horizontally or vertically.\n\nA key consideration involves the parity (color pattern) of the chessboard:\n- The \\(13 \\times 13\\) chessboard is essentially an odd by odd grid, hence contains a balanced number of squares of both colors, typical in a checkerboard pattern.\n- The central square (which is to remain uncovered) itself would be of one specific color.

Therefore, if a bishop is placed on a particular square, it can threaten any other bishop on the same diagonal.\n\n### Step-by-step Explanation:\n1. **Diagonals on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) board:**\n\n    - There are \\(15\\) possible diagonals in each diagonal direction on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) board (from the top-left to bottom-right, and from top-right to bottom-left).\n\n2. **Placing Bishops:**\n\n    - We need to place the bishops such that no more than two bishops are on the same diagonal and every bishop is only threatened by at most one other bishop. That means at most two bishops can be placed on each diagonal without violating the threat constraint.\n\n3. **Strategy for Maximum Placement:**\n\n    - The objective is to utilize the longer diagonals more effectively because these allow placing two bishops threatening each other.\n\n    - Specifically, for each longest diagonal, we place two bishops as they fully utilize the diagonal's length.\n\n4. **Calculation for Maximum Bishops:**\n\n    - The board can be broken into two sets of diagonals\u2014one set increasing from bottom-left to top-right and another set decreasing from top-left to bottom-right. Both sets have \\(15\\) diagonals each.\n\n    - Since no two bishops should be on the same cell, and adding more than two bishops on any diagonal would cause more threats than allowed, we can place two bishops on several diagonals and strategically use shorter diagonals as needed.\n\n5. **Final Determination:**\n\n    - To maximize, we primarily use \\(10\\) diagonals that can accommodate two bishops each.

A crucial observation here is that to separate two groups of points in the plane, we can draw lines in a manner analogous to drawing a linear separator, ensuring that one group is entirely on one side of the line and the other group is on the opposite side.\n\n### Step 3: Strategy with Minimum Lines\n\nFor every point, we can use lines to isolate each point of one color away from points of the opposite color. Since we are dealing with 2013 red points, we will aim to surround each point to separate it from the opposite color. To effectively surround each red point so that no blue points are allowed in-between, we can conceptualize needing \\( k = 2013 \\) lines covering potential linear separators.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Minimum Number of Lines\n\nGiven that for every red point to be completely isolated from being in the same region as a blue point, we have potentially \\( k = 2013 \\) necessary lines in the worst-case distribution of points due to the following reasons:\n\n- The minimum \\( k \\) lines is needed such that these lines can separate each red point effectively from all blue points.\n- Any configuration with fewer than 2013 lines risks a region containing both red and blue points as the density and placement may cluster more densely, exceeding half with both points.\n\nTherefore, the least number \\( k \\) of lines needed is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2013}\n\\] \n\nBy using 2013 lines wisely, we can ensure that all regions after demarcation contain points of only one color, satisfying both conditions for any Colombian configuration.

This reduction is valid because \\( B \\) can only select 10 consecutive buckets, and we can group these buckets into 8 larger buckets, each containing 10 of the original buckets. Thus, the problem simplifies to a scenario where \\( B \\) can only empty one of these larger buckets at a time.\n\nWe now play the game on \\( F(8, 1) \\). For \\( B \\), the optimal strategy is to empty the largest bucket all the time.

If the integer $x$ is placed in the leftmost square and the integer $y$ is placed in the rightmost square, what is the largest possible value of $x+y$?","solution":"From the given information, if $a$ and $b$ are in two consecutive squares, then $a+b$ goes in the circle between them. Since all of the numbers that we can use are positive, then $a+b$ is larger than both $a$ and $b$. This means that the largest integer in the list, which is 13, cannot be either $x$ or $y$ (and in fact cannot be placed in any square). This is because the number in the circle next to it must be smaller than 13 (because 13 is the largest number in the list) and so cannot be the sum of 13 and another positive number from the list. Thus, for $x+y$ to be as large as possible, we would have $x$ and $y$ equal to 10 and 11 in some order. But here we have the same problem: there is only one larger number from the list (namely 13) that can go in the circles next to 10 and 11, and so we could not fill in the circle next to both 10 and 11. Therefore, the next largest possible value for $x+y$ is when $x=9$ and $y=11$. Here, we could have $13=11+2$ and $10=9+1$, giving the following partial list: The remaining integers (4,5 and 6) can be put in the shapes in the following way that satisfies the requirements. This tells us that the largest possible value of $x+y$ is 20.","answer":"20","source":"fermat","secondary_domain":"Combinatorics"}
{"domain":["Mathematics -> Discrete Mathematics -> Combinatorics"],"difficulty":5.0,"problem":"Sean is a biologist, and is looking at a string of length 66 composed of the letters $A, T, C, G$. A substring of a string is a contiguous sequence of letters in the string. For example, the string $AGTC$ has 10 substrings: $A, G, T, C, AG, GT, TC, AGT, GTC, AGTC$. What is the maximum number of distinct substrings of the string Sean is looking at?","solution":"Let's consider the number of distinct substrings of length $\\ell$. On one hand, there are obviously at most $4^{\\ell}$ distinct substrings. On the other hand, there are $67-\\ell$ substrings of length $\\ell$ in a length 66 string. Therefore, the number of distinct substrings is at most $\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{66} \\min \\left(4^{\\ell}, 67-\\ell\\right)=2100$. To show that this bound is achievable, one can do a construction using deBrujin sequences that we won't elaborate on here.","answer":"2100","source":"HMMT_2","secondary_domain":"Combinatorics"}
{"domain":["Mathematics -> Discrete Mathematics -> Combinatorics"],"difficulty":5.0,"problem":"8 students are practicing for a math contest, and they divide into pairs to take a practice test. In how many ways can they be split up?","solution":"We create the pairs one at a time. The first person has 7 possible partners. Set this pair aside. Of the remaining six people, pick a person. He or she has 5 possible partners. Set this pair aside. Of the remaining four people, pick a person. He or she has 3 possible partners. Set this pair aside. Then the last two must be partners. So there are $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3=105$ possible groupings. Alternatively, we can consider the 8! permutations of the students in a line, where the first two are a pair, the next two are a pair, etc. Given a grouping, there are 4! ways to arrange the four pairs in order, and in each pair, 2 ways to order the students. So our answer is $\\frac{8!}{4!2^{4}}=7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3=105$.","answer":"105","source":"HMMT_11","secondary_domain":"Combinatorics"}
