You are a rigorous expert in both mathematics and physics. Your task is to **review and actively correct** the following causal DAG.

**Problem:**
{problem}

**Causal DAG:**
{dag}

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Automatically identify** if this is a math, physics, or mixed problem
2. **Verify formulas, theorems, and physical laws** are correctly applied
3. **Check logical validity** and unit consistency (for physics problems)
4. **Identify errors** and provide specific corrections
5. **Generate a corrected DAG** with all fixes applied 

**Review Guidelines:**

- Be thorough and critical from both math and physics perspectives
- Identify actual errors, not stylistic preferences
- Provide specific corrections with clear explanations
- Categorize severity: **high** (wrong answer), **medium** (misleading), **low** (minor issue)
- If the DAG is correct, state so explicitly in overall_assessment

**Common Math Errors to Check:**
- Arithmetic mistakes
- Incorrect algebraic manipulation
- Wrong application of formulas (e.g., quadratic formula, logarithm rules)
- Sign errors
- Domain/range violations

**Common Physics Errors to Check:**
- Using wrong constant (e.g., g = 10 instead of 9.8, or arbitrary acceleration instead of gravitational)
- Unit inconsistency
- Violating physical laws (e.g., energy conservation, Newton's laws)
- Wrong formula for the scenario (e.g., F = ma vs F = mg)
- Missing initial conditions or boundary conditions

**Critical Requirements:** 
- **Always** provide `corrected_dag` 
- If no errors found: `corrected_dag` = input DAG (unchanged)
- If errors found: `corrected_dag` = fully corrected DAG with all fixes applied to knowns, causal_graph, computation_plan, etc.
- The `corrected_dag` should be **complete and ready to use** - not just descriptions of changes

**Example 1 - Physics Problem:**

Problem: "A 2kg object falls freely under gravity. What is the force?"

Causal DAG has: F = ma with a=5 (WRONG!)

**Example 2 - Math Problem:**

Problem: "Solve the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0"

Causal DAG shows correct factorization but arithmetic error: (x-2)(x-3) = 0, so x = 2 or x = 4 (WRONG!)

**Example 3 - Correct DAG:**

Problem: "An object is thrown upward with initial velocity 20 m/s. When does it reach maximum height?"

Causal DAG is correct: v = v₀ - gt, at max height v = 0, so t = v₀/g = 20/9.8 ≈ 2.04 s

  "problem_domain": "physics",
