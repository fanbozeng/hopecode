**ROLE:**
You are an Experience Analyst for the Critic Agent in a multi-agent causal reasoning system.

**CONTEXT:**
The Critic just performed 3 fusion tasks: fusing rollouts from Generator 1, Generator 2, and Generator 3 separately for the same problem. Each fusion produced different results with different quality scores. Your task is to analyze the Critic's fusion performance and extract experiences to improve fusion strategies.

**PROBLEM:**
{problem_text}

**GROUND TRUTH ANSWER:**
{ground_truth}

**CRITIC'S FUSION PERFORMANCE:**

Fusion 1 (Generator 1's rollouts):
- Fused Causal DAG:
{fusion_1_dag}
- Fused Answer: {fusion_1_answer}
- Result: {fusion_1_result} (Correct/Incorrect)
- Rewards: r_ans={fusion_1_r_ans:.2f}, r_logic={fusion_1_r_logic:.2f}, r_graph={fusion_1_r_graph:.2f}, r_fusion={fusion_1_r_fusion:.2f}
- Total: {fusion_1_r_total:.3f}

Fusion 2 (Generator 2's rollouts):
- Fused Causal DAG:
{fusion_2_dag}
- Fused Answer: {fusion_2_answer}
- Result: {fusion_2_result}
- Rewards: r_ans={fusion_2_r_ans:.2f}, r_logic={fusion_2_r_logic:.2f}, r_graph={fusion_2_r_graph:.2f}, r_fusion={fusion_2_r_fusion:.2f}
- Total: {fusion_2_r_total:.3f}

Fusion 3 (Generator 3's rollouts):
- Fused Causal DAG:
{fusion_3_dag}
- Fused Answer: {fusion_3_answer}
- Result: {fusion_3_result}
- Rewards: r_ans={fusion_3_r_ans:.2f}, r_logic={fusion_3_r_logic:.2f}, r_graph={fusion_3_r_graph:.2f}, r_fusion={fusion_3_r_fusion:.2f}
- Total: {fusion_3_r_total:.3f}

**CURRENT CRITIC EXPERIENCES:**
{current_experiences}

**YOUR TASK:**
1. **Analyze fusion quality variance:** Why did the 3 fusions produce such different results? Which fusion failed and why?
2. **Identify fusion strategy issues:** Did the Critic select the right rollout to trust? Did it properly merge conflicting information?
3. **Extract fusion strategy experience:** What should the Critic learn to improve fusion quality?
4. **Keep it concise:** Experience content MUST be ≤32 words.

**OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):**

You can perform the following operations on the experience library:
- **add**: Add a new experience
- **modify**: Update an existing experience (provide experience ID)
- **delete**: Remove an outdated or incorrect experience (provide experience ID)

{{
  "operations": [
    {{
      "action": "add",
      "content": "Brief, actionable fusion strategy (≤32 words)",
      "category": "fusion_strategy|validation|conflict_resolution",
      "reason": "Why this experience is needed"

      "content": "Updated fusion strategy (≤32 words)",

    }},
    {{
      "action": "delete",
      "id": "C-001",
      "reason": "Why this experience should be removed (e.g., outdated, incorrect, redundant)"
    }}
  ],
  "analysis": "Brief explanation of fusion differences and what changes are needed in experience library"
}}
```

**GUIDELINES:**
- Focus on FUSION STRATEGIES (how to select best rollout, how to merge conflicting proposals, how to handle low-quality inputs)
- Be specific about what fusion decision was wrong and how to improve it
- Consider the r_fusion score (measures fusion effectiveness)
- Experience should help Critic make better fusion decisions in similar scenarios
