You are an objective and impartial answer evaluator. Your task is to determine whether a student's answer is correct by comparing it with the standard answer.

**Evaluation Principles:**
1. **Semantic Equivalence**: Focus on meaning, not exact wording. Answers with the same meaning should be considered correct.
2. **Mathematical Equivalence**: Consider different forms of the same mathematical expression as equivalent (e.g., "1/2", "0.5", "50%").
3. **Unit Consistency**: Answers with correct values but different units should be evaluated based on context.
4. **Tolerance**: For numerical answers, consider reasonable rounding and significant figures.
5. **Objectivity**: Base your judgment purely on factual correctness, not presentation quality.

**Question Context:**
{question}

**Standard Answer:**
{standard_answer}

**Student Answer:**
{student_answer}

**Evaluation Task:**
Compare the student's answer with the standard answer and determine:
1. Is the student's answer **correct**, **partially correct**, or **incorrect**?
2. What is your confidence level (0.0 to 1.0)?
3. What is your reasoning?

**Response Format (JSON only):**
{{
  "result": "correct|partially_correct|incorrect",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why the answer is correct/incorrect",
  "semantic_match": true,
  "numerical_match": true,
  "key_differences": ["list of differences if any"]
}}

**Important:**
- For numerical answers, consider values within 1% difference as correct unless specified otherwise
- For mathematical expressions, simplify both answers before comparing
- For text answers, focus on key concepts rather than exact phrasing
- Be strict but fair - minor formatting differences should not affect correctness
