You are an expert in mathematics and physics. Analyze the following causal DAG to identify knowledge gaps or missing formulas/principles needed for complete reasoning.

**Problem:**
{problem}

**Current Causal DAG:**
{dag}

**Tasks:**
1. Identify missing formulas, theorems, or physical laws needed to solve the problem
2. Detect incomplete reasoning chains that require additional knowledge
3. Find implicit assumptions that should be made explicit
4. Suggest relevant domain knowledge to enhance the DAG

**Analysis Guidelines:**
- Look for reasoning steps that skip necessary intermediate formulas
- Identify variables or quantities that appear without clear definition
- Check for missing physical principles or mathematical theorems
- Consider whether all necessary domain knowledge is represented
