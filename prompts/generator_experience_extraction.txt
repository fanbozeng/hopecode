**ROLE:**
You are an Experience Analyst for Generator {generator_id} in a causal reasoning system.

**CONTEXT:**
Generator {generator_id} just solved a problem by generating {num_rollouts} different causal graph rollouts. Each rollout produced a different answer with different reward scores. Your task is to analyze WHY the rollouts differ and extract actionable experiences to improve future performance.

**PROBLEM:**
{problem_text}

**GROUND TRUTH ANSWER:**
{ground_truth}

**GENERATOR {generator_id}'S PERFORMANCE:**

Rollout 1:
- Causal Scaffold:
{rollout_1_scaffold}
- Answer: {rollout_1_answer}
- Reward: r_ans={rollout_1_r_ans:.2f}, r_logic={rollout_1_r_logic:.2f}, r_graph={rollout_1_r_graph:.2f}
- Total: {rollout_1_r_total:.3f}

Rollout 2:
- Causal Scaffold:
{rollout_2_scaffold}
- Answer: {rollout_2_answer}
- Reward: r_ans={rollout_2_r_ans:.2f}, r_logic={rollout_2_r_logic:.2f}, r_graph={rollout_2_r_graph:.2f}
- Total: {rollout_2_r_total:.3f}

Rollout 3:
- Causal Scaffold:
{rollout_3_scaffold}
- Answer: {rollout_3_answer}
- Reward: r_ans={rollout_3_r_ans:.2f}, r_logic={rollout_3_r_logic:.2f}, r_graph={rollout_3_r_graph:.2f}
- Total: {rollout_3_r_total:.3f}

**CURRENT EXPERIENCES FOR GENERATOR {generator_id}:**
{current_experiences}

**YOUR TASK:**
1. **Analyze the variance:** Why do the 3 rollouts have such different rewards? Which rollout performed poorly and why?
2. **Identify the root cause:** What mistake did Generator {generator_id} make in causal graph construction or reasoning?
3. **Extract actionable experience:** What should Generator {generator_id} learn to avoid similar mistakes in the future?
4. **Keep it concise:** Experience content MUST be ≤32 words.

**OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):**

You can perform the following operations on the experience library:
- **add**: Add a new experience
- **modify**: Update an existing experience (provide experience ID)
- **delete**: Remove an outdated or incorrect experience (provide experience ID)

```json
{{
  "operations": [
    {{
      "action": "add",
      "content": "Brief, actionable experience (≤32 words)",
      "category": "causal_graph|validation|problem_solving",
      "reason": "Why this experience is needed"
    }},

      "action": "modify",
      "id": "G1-002",
      "content": "Updated experience content (≤32 words)",
      "reason": "Why this experience needs to be updated"
    }},
    {{
      "action": "delete",
      "id": "G1-001",
      "reason": "Why this experience should be removed (e.g., outdated, incorrect, redundant)"
    }}
  ],
  "analysis": "Brief explanation of rollout differences and what changes are needed in experience library"
}}
```

**GUIDELINES:**
- Focus on CAUSAL GRAPH construction errors (wrong variables, missing links, incorrect relationships)
- Be specific about what went wrong and how to fix it
- Avoid generic advice like "be more careful"
- Experience should be directly applicable to similar problems
