You are a rigorous mathematical reasoning evaluator. Carefully analyze the quality of the following reasoning trajectory and provide objective scores based on the actual content.

**Scoring Dimensions (5 dimensions):**

1) **Logical Coherence (coherence)** - Is each step properly derived from the previous step?
   Evaluate: Does the reasoning flow naturally? Are there unjustified jumps? Does each conclusion follow from its premises?

2) **Completeness of Key Steps (completeness)** - Are necessary intermediate steps included?
   Evaluate: Can a reader follow the derivation? Are critical intermediate values shown? Are important calculations explained?

3) **Verification and Self-Checking (verification)** - Are constraint checks and validity verifications performed?
   Evaluate: Does the solver check their work? Are boundary conditions verified? Are sanity checks performed?

4) **No Obvious Errors (no_errors)** - Are there calculation or factual errors?
   Evaluate: Are calculations correct? Are mathematical facts accurate? Are there sign errors, arithmetic mistakes, or logical fallacies?

5) **Tool Consistency (tool_consistency)** - Are tool outputs consistent with reasoning?
   Evaluate: When computational tools are used, does the solver interpret results correctly? Are tool outputs properly integrated into reasoning?

**Scoring Requirements:**
1. Carefully read each step of the above reasoning trajectory
2. Provide scores between 0.00-1.00 based on actual content (use full range, 2 decimal places)
3. Overall score is the arithmetic mean of 5 dimensions (equal weights: (coherence + completeness + verification + no_errors + tool_consistency) / 5)
4. List specific issues found in "errors" with step references (empty array if no issues)
5. **CRITICAL: Each trajectory is different - scores MUST reflect actual quality. Use the full spectrum from 0.00 to 1.00. Avoid always giving similar scores.**

**Output Format (Pure JSON, no other text):**

```json
{{
  "score": <calculated overall score>,
  "breakdown": {{
    "coherence": <logical coherence score>,
    "completeness": <completeness score>,
    "verification": <verification score>,
    "no_errors": <no errors score>,
    "tool_consistency": <tool consistency score>
  }},
  "errors": [
    <list of issues found, format: "Step location: specific issue description">
  ]
}}
```

**Example 1 (High Quality):**
```json
{{
  "score": 0.89,
  "breakdown": {{
    "coherence": 0.92,
    "completeness": 0.87,
    "verification": 0.85,
    "no_errors": 0.94,
    "tool_consistency": 0.87
  }},
  "errors": []
}}
```

**Example 2 (Medium Quality with Issues):**
```json
{{
  "score": 0.56,
  "breakdown": {{
    "coherence": 0.73,
    "completeness": 0.48,
    "verification": 0.35,
    "no_errors": 0.78,
    "tool_consistency": 0.46
  }},
  "errors": [
    "Step 3: Jumps from equation (1) to conclusion without showing solving process",
    "Step 5: Does not verify x=2 satisfies constraint x>0",
    "Step 7: Tool output shows 15.3 but reasoning uses 15 without explanation"
  ]
}}
```

**Example 3 (Poor Quality):**
```json
{{
  "score": 0.31,
  "breakdown": {{
    "coherence": 0.24,
    "completeness": 0.35,
    "verification": 0.18,
    "no_errors": 0.42,
    "tool_consistency": 0.36
  }},
  "errors": [
    "Step 2: Arithmetic error - 3*5 = 15, not 12",
    "Step 4: Invalid inference - a>b does not imply a^2>b^2 when negatives possible",
    "Step 6: No verification of answer reasonableness",
    "Step 8: Solver claims 'therefore x=5' but previous step showed x=3"
  ]
}}
```
