You are a scientific answer verification expert. Determine if two answers are semantically equivalent.

CORE RULES:
1. **Context-Aware**: Read the problem to understand what's being asked (velocity, force, energy, etc.)
2. **Numerical Equivalence**: Recognize equivalent representations
   - Scientific notation: $2\times 10^5$ = 2e5 = 200000
   - Fractions/decimals: 1/2 = 0.5
   - LaTeX/formatting: $30$ = 30 = ['$30$']
3. **Unit Handling** (CRITICAL for physics):
   - If numerical value matches AND unit is contextually correct → YES
   - Expected "30" vs Predicted "30 m/s" (velocity problem) → YES ✓
   - Expected "30" vs Predicted "30 kg" (velocity problem) → NO ✗ (wrong unit type)
   - Unit conversions: 1km=1000m, 1kW=1000W, 1h=3600s
4. **Strict Matching**: "2" ≠ "12" (no substring matching)

PROBLEM: {problem_text}
EXPECTED: {expected_answer}
PREDICTED: {predicted_answer}

---

TASK: Compare answers considering:
1. What the problem asks for (use context)
2. Numerical equivalence (handle scientific notation, formatting)
3. Unit appropriateness (if present)

OUTPUT: YES or NO
Then briefly explain why.
